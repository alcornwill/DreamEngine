how set up development workstation for DreamEngine (working title)
	the DreamEngine folder only contains the source code for the engine, you have to download (and sometimes build) the dependencies
	(the 'final product' sdk should be a lot easier to install if I can precompile things for any platform and create an installer)		
		and just runing games should hopefully be as simple as running an .exe, once engine is installed
	I use Windows 8.1 x64, but it could work on any platform, though many steps will be different
		and many bugs will need to be fixed
	requirements:
		many GB of hard drive space
		OpenGL 4.0 or better (you will need to update your graphics driver if you haven't done so recently, otherwise you get weird bugs)
		
this guide walks you though installing:
	assimp
		msvc2015	
	Qt (for pyqt)
	python 3.6
		numpy
		pygame
		pyopengl
		pyqt5
		pyassimp
		(pyinstrument for profiling)
	to actually make games
		a python IDE (PyCharm is strongly recommended, very good) (I do use Notepad++ as well)
		a 3D modeling application (blender is strongly recommended, very good)
		other shit
			digital painting software / image manipulation (Paint.net, gimp, paint tool sai, I use many)
			DAW to make busic
			a midi keyboard
			a camera
			(make your own tools!)
	to build C++
		ms build tools
		a C++ compiler (I used MinGW)
		cmake

--------------------
		steps:		
--------------------

assimp:
	assimp allows us to import 3D models into our application from many formats (.fbx, .obj, ...)
	it is a C++ API but it comes with a python port called pyassimp, which works very nicely
	if you are running Windows x64 you don't need to build assimp, you can use the .dll I built
		(untested though)		
		install msvc2015
			run "DreamEngine\vc_redist.x64.exe"
		copy dll
			after installed python and installed pyassimp module (see below)
			copy "DreamEngine\assimp.dll" to site-packages		
	
	if that doesn't work you need to build assimp from the sources
	download assimp 
		https://github.com/assimp/assimp ('Clone or download' -> 'Download zip')		
	install ms build tools 2015
		https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48159
	install Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015
		(distributing the installer or the .dll's it installs might be illegal)
		https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145
	install MinGW
		just follow this: http://www.mingw.org/wiki/Getting_Started
		I installed mingw32-core and g++ extension
		had to add MinGW/bin to path environment variable
		to build with cmake:
			cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles"
			mingw32-make
	install cmake		
		https://cmake.org/download/		
		run installer
			TICK 'add cmake to path for all users'			
	build (finally)
		run cmake gui
			browse to assimp directory (with CMakeLists.txt file)
			for the build directory create a folder called 'build' and browse to it
			press 'configure'
			choose "MinGW Makefiles"
				if you choose the wrong one go to: File -> delete cache
			you can untick all the features you don't need and it will probably make the dll smaller?
				I unticked all the importers except .fbx, .obj, .ply and .blend
			press 'generate'
				red is ok but you shouldn't see any errors
		build (in command prompt in cmake build directory with 'Makefile' in)
			"mingw32-make"
		you will find assimp.dll somewhere in the build folder 
			it may be called something slightly different, depending on compiler
			pyassimp will still find it as long as it has 'assimp' somewhere in the name

	(top tip)
		cmake and mingw can be used from the command line to make+build automatically
			CD project_dir
			MKDIR build
			CD build
			cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..
			mingw32-make
			
QT
	(ok not actually sure you need this. probably do though)
	QT is the gui library used with DreamEngine (pyQt)
	unfortunately QT is a huge library with loads of stuff we don't need. we are only interested in the .dlls, but it's easier to just install everything
	install
		http://info.qt.io/download-qt-for-application-development
			(you do NOT need to buy QT)
		run the installer
		skip the login page
		you can untick everything except latest (stable) version (5.8 for me)
			(I'm using QTCharts as well)

python
	python is the perfect programming language, everything about it is perfect in every way
	installing python is not straightforward unfortunately (read carefully)
	install
		download latest version from https://www.python.org/downloads/
			(3.6.1 at time of writing)			
			on windows, the default install location will be Program Files
			but this means you have to use administrator command prompt to install modules, which I find annoying
			so install it somewhere that doesn't require administrator privilages				
				run the installer
				UNTICK 'Install launcher for all users'
				TICK add python to path
				choose 'Customize installation'
				Optional Features
					leave as they are, click 'Next'
				Advanced Options
					change 'Customize install location' to:
						'C:\whatever\...\python36' (or whatever)
					(tick 'download debugging symbols'?)
						pycharm debugging seems to work without it, but maybe it installed it automatically lmao. need to google what it means
					click 'Next'
				(you may be prompted to install C runtime binaries, click 'Ok')
				python will then be installed
	install modules	
		install with pip (in windows command prompt "python -m pip install module_name")
			(ok now that I've done setup.py pycharm should offer to install these, or maybe they will be installed automatically?)
			numpy
			pygame
			pyopengl
			(optional)
				pyqt5
				pyinstrument (profiling)
		pyassimp
			this does exist on pypi, but I'm not sure how recent that version is
			since you downloaded pyassimp just install from that anyway
				open a command prompt in 'assimp/port/PyAssimp'
					"python setup.py install"					
			either way you will still need assimp.dll (it goes in "site-packages\pyassimp\")

pycharm
	you can use whatever IDE you want, but pycharm is good
	cool features:
		when you read a .frag or .vert file pycharm will offer to install an addon for glsl syntax highlighting!
	installation
		download pycharm 'Community' from https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows
		run installer and follow instructions
	running for the first time
		instead of creating new project, choose 'Open'
		navigate to DreamEngine/DreamEngine directory
		the project is loaded but none of the python module depedencies are there
		when the project has loaded, it should say 'no python interpreter configured for the project'. click 'Configure Python Interpreter'
		just browse to 'python36/python.exe' (if pycharm hasn't already found it) and continue
		the red lines should go away now and it should run

that's it! The End
			
blender
	(obviously you only need this if you intend to do 3D modelling)
	blender has some quirks, I ragequit many times while learning, but you will learn to appreciate it for the miracle that it is
	cool features:
		lots of amazing stuff like cycles renderer, simulation, sculpting, material node editor, automatic rigging and uv unwrap, ...
		blender is written in python, so you can write addons in python. blender has an immediate mode console built in
		a jaw dropping feature of blender is that you can hover over any GUI element and see the source code!

newb how-tos
	(todo)
	use command prompt
	run as administrator
	batch files
	use pycharm
	why do i have to compile things, what are binaries and source code and .dlls
	"assimp library not found"
		you built assimp for the wrong platform/architecture (or didn't build it at all...)
	python
		command line			
		immediate mode
		how to use pip
			(on windows) open a command prompt anywhere
				type "python -m pip install module_name"
				if you see anyone online telling you to use "pip install module_name" they are using linux				
		how to use a 'setup.py'
			modules that don't use pip are usually installed with a setup.py
			in command prompt run "python setup.py install"
		site-packages
			python modules are installed in "python36\Lib\site-packages"
		basic syntax
	common errors and pitfalls
		command "python" not found
			you didn't add the python36 directory to path environment variable		
	what is QT, why is it so big and why do i have to install it
